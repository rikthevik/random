# Advent2019

The Advent of Code 2019!

## Running Scripts

Originally I was using `mix run`, but it looks like `mix test` is a better fit.
Let's try a bottom-up method of writing and testing simple functions.

```
$ mix test problems/problem01.ex

If you tag a test with @tag :whatever
$ mix test problems/problem01.ex --only whatever

```


## Installation

Don't?
