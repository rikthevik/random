None of these projects are big enough to warrant their own repo, and it's kind of fun to see everything in the same place.  The advent of code is usually pretty fun and it was a great way to learn Elixir.

I make no claims about whether any of this code works anymore. There are certainly some half-thoughts that have been committed here. Fun to look back, though.
